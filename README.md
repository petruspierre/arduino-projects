# Arduino projects

Almost all Arduino and ESP projects made by me that i had in my old PC. I didn't reviewed all these projects but decided to upload here.

### So i'll list some relevant projects that have in this repo now :)

## ESP

- [Template for Telegram BOT](https://github.com/petruspierre/arduinoProjects/blob/master/ESP/TemplateParaTelegramBot/TemplateParaTelegramBot.ino)<br>
A application with a template for use with [UniversalTelegramBot](https://github.com/witnessmenow/Universal-Arduino-Telegram-Bot) on ESP32/8266
Very simple to use and maybe i improve it and make other repo with this project

- [Control GPIO ports with AppInventor](https://github.com/petruspierre/arduinoProjects/blob/master/ESP/appInventor/appInventor.ino)<br>
It can be useful to test something, basically it is for set the logical state of the GPIO ports in ESP32. You will need the app made in [Kodular](https://www.kodular.io)

- [Multithread](https://github.com/petruspierre/arduinoProjects/blob/master/ESP/multiprocessamento/multiprocessamento.ino)<br>
Also a very useful one where you can use the dual core of ESP32 and use two parallel threads. Maybe I make one special repo for this one too.

- [Over The Air](https://github.com/petruspierre/arduinoProjects/blob/master/ESP/templateOTA/templateOTA.ino)<br>
A program to use the feature of Over The Air updates in ESP32, it's very useful to send programs wireless as the name suggests.

## "PROJETOS COMPLETOS"
The projects that i finished when i was learning about Arduino and my sensors.
I pretend upload also all the circuits in the future.

- [Time reaction game](https://github.com/petruspierre/arduinoProjects/blob/master/PROJETOS%20COMPLETOS/jogoTempoReacao/jogoTempoReacao.ino)<br>
A very funny game that you can do using any Arduino board, LCD display and some led and buttons.

- [Stopwatch](https://github.com/petruspierre/arduinoProjects/blob/master/PROJETOS%20COMPLETOS/cronometro/cronometro.ino)<br>
A simple stopwatch with Arduino, LCD Display and buttons.

## "ROBÔS"
Actually it should be my robots projects but i made some special repo for each of them. So the projects in the directory "ROBÔS" are just some tests.

- [Jedi](https://github.com/petruspierre/jedi)<br>
The robot that me and my team made for Brazilian Robotics Olympics in 2019. More informations in the repo :)

- Turtle<br>
Uh Oh! This repo is now private but it is because is my team's robot for the Brazilian Robotics Olympics in 2020, so in 2021 i will make this repo as public :)

And that's it! Hope that at least one project of these can help you and you feel free to take it for you and make your changes. I'll be there for help in what i could.
